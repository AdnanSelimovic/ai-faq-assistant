# AGENTS

Read this file before making changes.

- Read before write: scan `PROJECT_STATUS.md`, `README.md`, and relevant files.
- Keep diffs small and incremental; avoid sweeping refactors.
- Use repo scripts only; never invent commands or tools.
- Run verification commands when appropriate (`composer test`, `php artisan test`, `npm run build`).
- Update docs when behavior, setup, or deployment guidance changes.
- Do not modify dependencies unless explicitly requested.
- Do not commit secrets or real credentials.
- Prefer clear, reversible changes with minimal risk.

See `docs/AGENTIC_CODING_GUIDELINES.md` for full guidance.
