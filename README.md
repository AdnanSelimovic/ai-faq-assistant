## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

## License

The Laravel framework is open-sourced software licensed under the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

## KB document uploads

The admin "Create Document" screen supports optional file uploads (PDF, DOCX, PPTX). If raw text is pasted, it takes priority and the upload is ignored. The file is only used for text extraction and is not stored.

PDF extraction uses the `smalot/pdfparser` library and does not require external binaries.

## Ask answer modes

The dashboard Ask flow supports two modes:
- `extractive` (default): summarizes top retrieved chunks without external calls and appends a Sources line.
- `llm`: uses the OpenAI Responses API with retrieved chunks as context.

The selected mode is stored in a `kb_ask_mode` cookie (set via an AJAX POST to `/preferences/ask-mode`) and remembered across sessions.

Required env/config for LLM mode:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `OPENAI_MODEL` (default `gpt-4o-mini`)
- `OPENAI_STORE` (default false)
- `ASK_MAX_CONTEXT_CHUNKS` (default 5)
- `ASK_MAX_CONTEXT_CHARS` (default 4000)
